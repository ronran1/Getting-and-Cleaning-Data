# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Course Project - Ron Ran

### This project aims to demonstrate how R can be used to parse large sums of data
from wearables.

## Dataset
Taken from the **UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset**, which can be found here.

This file will show the data used, variables, and how I tidied up the data.

This file is the code file, which follows the guidelines proposed in the 
**Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project** outlined in Coursera.
> Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
